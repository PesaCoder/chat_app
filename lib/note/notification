Push notifications have two parts:
    one is notification (title and message),
    and one is additional data. Iâ€™m going to use only the first part in this demo scope.


======================open specific screen==========================
In case you would like to navigate or do something
when the user clicks on a notification instead of open the app as the default,
consider using additional data since
it has data payload and handle click_action: FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK.
